For the extremely impatient:
  # make install

This installs everything into /usr/local by default. For better control use
the following variables:
  PREFIX	The installation prefix
  SYSCONFDIR	The location of the system wide config files
  DESTDIR	Specifies a directory to prepend to the installation paths,
		useful for packagers.

So to create a package directory in $PWD/pkg that has a /usr prefix and 
/etc for config files (normal paths on Linux) use the following command:
  $ make DESTDIR=$PWD/pkg PREFIX=/usr SYSCONFDIR=/etc install

The script config.sh will make an educated guess based on your operating
system:
  $ ./scripts/config.sh
