# Ported to wmpipe from date-menu.sh, an openbox pipe menu.

# This is in the public domain.  Honestly, how can you claim anything to something
# this simple?
#
# Outputs a simple openbox pipe menu to display the date, time, and calendar.
# You need 'date' and 'cal'.  You should have these.  Additionally, the calendar
# only appears properly formated if you use a mono spaced font.

# Outputs the selected row from the calender output.
# If you don't use a mono spaced font, you would have to play with spacing here.
# It would probably involve a very complicated mess.  Is there a way to force a
# different font per menu?
