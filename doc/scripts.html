<!-- Overview -->
<h3>Included Scripts</h3>

<h4>Applications menu</h4>
<h5>pekappmenu.sh | obappmenu.sh | iceappmenu.sh</h5>
<p>Probably the most used/requested pipe menu for any wm is an applications menu. There are
numerous implementations of this concept and I have used many, hacked quite a few and
continuously been frustrated when they stop working due to ABI changes (C), unicode errors
(Python) and lots or other quirks. So I decided, partially out of frustration and partially
for the challenge of it, to implement a solution in a shell script. Haha.</p>

<p>This little gem actually works surprisingly well within the constraints of it's design. It
is by no means a full-featured design and the menu it generates is not xdg compliant,
even though it functions by scanning the .desktop files in /usr/share/applications. The layout
does not follow the xdg spec by using xml menu definition files and .directory files but is
instead hard coded. Nevertheless the menus it creates are eminently usable and complete, and
there is some provision for customization in that applications can be excluded from showing up
via config file settings.</p>

<p>The first run will be extremely slow as each .desktop file must be scanned and processed
(around 4s on my computer). Each run thereafter is very quick as it builds a cache in ~/.cache
for it's data. If the contents of /usr/share/applications are changed then the cache will be
rebuilt.</p>

<h4>Places</h4>
<h5>pekplaces.sh | obplaces.sh | iceplaces.sh</h5>
<p>The idea of this script is to replicate the "Places" submenu ala gnome2. The menu
includes entries for your home directory, the full filesystem, gtk bookmarks and recently
used files. Optionally you can also make the home directory a browsable submenu via the
filebrowser script and include bookmarks from ROX-Filer via config file options.</p>

<h4>Filebrowser</h4>
<h5>pekfb.sh | obfb.sh | icefb.sh</h5>
<p>This script creates a browsable filesystem tree allowing you to navigate the unix
filesystem from your wm menu. Within each directory there are options to open the
default filemanager, open a terminal here, and open files using the default applications
as governed by the filehandler chosen in the config file. Can be used in conjunction with
the "Places" pipemenu to make your home directory a browseable submenu.</p>

<h4>MPD</h4>
<h5>pekmpd.sh | obmpd.sh | icempd.sh</h5>
<p>Control MPD (Music Player daemon) from your wm menu. Supports basic functionality like
playing, pausing, skipping forward and back, volume control. Does not replace a full client
as there is no provision for building playlists.</p>

<h4>Wallpaper</h4>
<h5>pekwp.sh | obwp.sh | icewp.sh</h5>
<p>Set your desktop wallpaper from the wm menu. Very handy.</p>

<h4>Webmarks</h4>
<h5>pekwebmarks.sh | obwebmarks.sh | icewebmarks.sh</h5>
<p>Quick access to bookmarks from certain web browsers. Currently only Midori, DWB and
qutebrowser are supported. To be developed further...</p>

<h4>Calendar</h4>
<h5>pekcal.sh | obcal.sh | icecal.sh</h5>
<p>Displays a simple calendar in your wm menu.</p>
